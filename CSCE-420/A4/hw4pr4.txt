a)  From the given values we know that:

    Each camera has 512 x 512 pixels on a 10 x 10 square sensor
    The lense of each camera has a focal length of 16 cm
    The cameras are 1 meter apart and are parallel to each other. 

    To calculate the largest disparity at a distance of 16 meters, similar triangles can be used.
    Since, the cameras are 1 meter apart, the middle point would a distance of 0.5 meters. And so, 
    a triangle with w = 16 m, h = 0.5 m equates to a similar triangle with w = 16 cm, h = 0.5 cm. 

    Since the sensor is a square, the disparity needs to be multiplied by 2, where the disparity = 1.0 cm. 

    The calculation would look something like this:
    
        Disparity = 2 * (512)/(10) * 16 * (0.5/16) = 51.2

    With the camera using a 512 x 512 pixels on a 10 x 10 square sensor, at a distance of 16 meters, the disparity would be 51.2 pixels

b)  Similarly using the equation above, we can calculate a distance by plugging in pixel disparity. 
    The question asks for a distance resolution at 16 meters for pixel spaceing. Since the distance is the same as part a, we know that the
    disparity is 51.2. And so, we can compare the two distances for the disparities of 52 and 51. 

    Plugging in the values we get:

        52 = 2 * (512)/(10) * 16 * (0.5/x), we get that x = 15.75 meters
        51 = 2 * (512)/(10) * 16 * (0.5/x), we get that x = 16.06 meters

    The difference between these two values gives us 31 cm. 

c)  We can plug in values into the equation to calculate the distance for a disparity of 1 pixel 
    Plugging in the values we get:

        1 = 2 * (512)/(10) * 16 * (0.5/x), we get that x = 819.2 meters
