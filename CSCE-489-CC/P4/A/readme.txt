[Part A]
- Spent approximately 8 hours to complete the task
- Split the hwdr-config file into two pickle formatted files. hdwr-data.pkl and rack-data.pkl.
- Used pickle to save instances into instance-data.pkl with the format 
  <name> <image> <flavor> <physical machine>
- Really messy program with a lot of if conditions. However, enforces exceptional error checking. 

[How to run]
- Program accepts arguments using the command line. 
- Ex. python script.py aggiestack config --hardware hdwr-config.txt

[Note]
- Python Version = 3.6.2
