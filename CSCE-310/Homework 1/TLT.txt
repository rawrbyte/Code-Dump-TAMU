To describe time we can look at the speed of cpus where the baseline is 1 ghz representing a second in human time. 
1 mhz = 16.7 minutes
1 khz = 
1 hz = 


To describe latency we can look at downloading a file where the baseline is downloading a 1 kb file every second.
One order of magnitude higher is downloading a file size of 1 mb every second.
Two orders of magnitude higher is downloading a file size of 1 gb every second.
Three orders of magnitude higher is downloading a file size of 1 tb every second. 

To describe throughput we can look at a highway ramp where the baseline is one vehicle getting through every second.
One order of magnitude higher is at noon where many vehicles are getting on and off the highway every second.
Two orders of magnitude higher is during rush hour where hundred of vehicles line up to get on the ramp every second.
Three orders of magnitude higher is when an accident occurs during rush hour slowing vehicles entering the ramp every second.
